Explanation of Issue in Calender.py and debugging steps

Limitations and Issues:

The code has a significant flaw in its insert method within the Node class. The conditionals are insufficient to prevent overlapping bookings. It simply tries to insert the new node as a child, not checking for actual overlap completely. For example:
Imagine bookings:

(10, 20)

(15, 25)

The second booking overlaps with the first. However, the code might incorrectly place the second node as a right or left child depending on the order of insertion. This should return False (booking failed), but the implementation is incorrect and could allow overlapping bookings.

To fix the overlapping issue, you'd need to check if the new booking's start is less than the current node's end AND the new booking's end is greater than the current node's start. This condition precisely represents an overlap. Then it should return False

The primary issue with the original code in calender.py is that its insert method within the Node class doesn't accurately detect overlapping bookings. It attempts to insert nodes based on a partial comparison of start and end times, potentially creating a tree with overlapping intervals.

Debugging Steps:

Identify the core problem: The insert method needs a more robust overlap check. The current logic only considers if one interval's start is before the other's end or vice versa â€“ it doesn't fully account for cases where intervals partially or fully overlap.

Implement a precise overlap check: We need a condition that definitively determines if two intervals overlap. Two intervals [start1, end1) and [start2, end2) overlap if and only if: start1 < end2 AND start2 < end1.

Modify the insert method: The insert method should check for overlaps before inserting a new node. If an overlap is detected, it should return False immediately; otherwise, it should proceed with insertion.

Test thoroughly: Test with various scenarios to ensure the corrected code accurately handles overlapping and non-overlapping bookings.
